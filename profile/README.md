# Code Review Study

Each of the repositories in this organization is one PR from the original repository that has been merged already.
Not all PRs are represented in the final version that has been merged.
Some are based on a version prior to a review that suggested changes.

## Study procedure

Start by opening the PR assigned to you for this study. When the recording starts, you can begin your review process.
Please think aloud and reason your steps. You may access any additional information you deem relevant for your task.
Only exception is the original PR in the original repository. However, you may access other PRs from that repository that are referenced.

Your goal is to create a review on the PR by leaving comments (either on code lines directly or on the PR itself)
and concluding a final verdict (approval, changes requested, unable to properly review the PR).
Please do your best in reviewing the PR, but if you do not feel confident in your ability to review the PR thoroughly, it is perfectly acceptable to express this uncertainty.
